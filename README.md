## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- By default some browsers set the opacity value of placeholder text less than unity.
- There is a pseudo class called 'focus-within' which can be used to focus the div containing say a button element.
- Used css animation and for the specific use case it was implemented, css transition was not doing the work.
- Used event delegation and data attribute.
- Used the useRef hook to select a div element.
